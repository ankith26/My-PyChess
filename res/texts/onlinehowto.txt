My-PyChess supports Online Gameplay!!


But there is a minor catch, you have to host the
server yourself. Don't let that scare you, it is
very easy to do. Just run server.py code in your 
machine! 

To start with, run the server.py. It will print
the server log in the shell. Now, on the same 
machine run TWO INSTANCES of pychess.py.
On both, enter this IP ADDRESS '127.0.0.1', 
which is the local IP address of your machine.
Now, you are in the online lobby. Send a game
request and start playing chess!!


For more information on how to manage the server
or how you could play chess with anybody in the 
world (truly online), read more in ref/online.txt

Ok, I got it
