If you are running Debian or Debian-based OS (like
Ubuntu, Mint, Raspbian, etc), open the shell and 
type:
>> sudo apt-get install stockfish

If you are running Fedora, do:
>> sudo dnf install stockfish

If you are running openSUSE or similar OS, do:
>> sudo zypper install stockfish

If you are running centOS or similar OS, do:
>> sudo yum install stockfish

Your OS is not on this list?

NOTE: I HAVE NOT TESTED ANY OF THESE INSTALLATION
METHODS APART FROM THE ONE FOR DEBIAN, SO I CAN
NOT GIVE GUARANTEE THAT THE OTHER METHODS WORK.
